# D.W. Emacs Inspired by the Supernatural Show with Dean Winchester

## Requirements

- [JetBrains Mono Font](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) - This is a free font you can download here. The font is specified in the init.el if you want to change it.
- Tested on Emacs 28.1, probably will work on older versions

## Installation

Backup and move your .emacs.d directory if you have one. Also if you have a .emacs file move this file. Then run this command from the terminal. You can also manually download the repo, unzip it and rename it .emacs.d

```
git clone https://github.com/Tunkert/D.W.-Emacs ~/.emacs.d
```
